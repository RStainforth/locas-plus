SOC Files Go In this Directory
==========

SOC files should have the naming convention:

      [RUN-ID]_Run.root
For example, the SOC file corresponding to run with run ID "123456" should be placed in this directory with the filename:

      123456_Run.root
This is the current required naming convention for LOCAS to read SOC files.
