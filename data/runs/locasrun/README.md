OCARun Files are Written to this Directory
==========

OCA will write OCARun files with the following naming convention:

      [RUN-ID]_OCARun.root
For example, the OCARun file corresponding to the SOC file "123456_Run.root" which corresponds to the run with run ID "123456" will be written to:

      123456_OCARun.root
This is the current naming convention used by OCA to write OCARun files.
