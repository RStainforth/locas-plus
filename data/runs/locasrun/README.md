LOCASRun Files are Written to this Directory
==========

LOCAS will write LOCASRun files with the following naming convention:

      [RUN-ID]_LOCASRun.root
For example, the LOCASRun file corresponding to the SOC file "123456_Run.root" which corresponds to the run with run ID "123456" will be written to:

      123456_LOCASRun.root
This is the current naming convention used by LOCAS to write LOCASRun files.
